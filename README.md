# ICN-WSN
18 combination cache methon of ICN-WSN
This project is under and supported by China NSF.
ICN-WSN is an implement of ICN in WSN. We implement the basic ICN function like CS, FIB,PIT, and naming scheme.
This project is used for test the performance of each cache strategy.
We have design a new WSN cache strategy and deploy it in real physical world, then we compare our strategy with other 16 combination.
This new strategy consist of three part: cache size adjusting, cache decision strategy and cache replacement algorithm.
